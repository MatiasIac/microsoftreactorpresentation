# Microsoft Reactor Presentation

Source code of Microsoft Reactor led on March of 2022 presentations.

## Dino CV

This is a hand-made partial reconstruction of the Offline Chrome game.

This game uses the graphic assets that can be found when Chrome goes offline and the game is presented. I do not own the right for these graphics but I am assuming that Google will not get mad because I am using them to share knowledge... right Google... right?

The game has been made using jsGFwk. A javascript video game framework created by me. Free for use and open source. You can find the framework here [https://github.com/MatiasIac/jsGFwk](https://github.com/MatiasIac/jsGFwk).

The solution uses Lobe for a rapid CV model creation and training, and TensorflowJS to execute the predictions.

This code is totally free. If helped you, I am happy with that. If you would like to collaborate with some $$, I will be also happy :D... nah... all good. Just enjoy it if you found it valuable for you.

Cheers!
